## Implementation

### Server Components
```cpp
// Core security features
class SecurityManager {
    void initializeProtection();
    void monitorGameState();
    void handleSecurityEvents();
};
```

### Client Integration
```cpp
// Client-side protection
class ClientGuard {
    bool validateIntegrity();
    void preventModification();
    void secureConnection();
};
```

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Initialize security system
./configure --enable-security
make install

# Start protected server
./athena-start --secure
```
