## Technical Implementation

### Server Integration

```cpp
// P2P Security Configuration
p2p_security: {
    enabled: true
    security_level: 3
    monitoring_interval: 5000
    host_requirements: {
        min_cpu: 2.0
        min_ram: 8
        min_network: 10
    }
}
```

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Host tracking
CREATE TABLE p2p_hosts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    host_score FLOAT,
    total_uptime INT,
    last_online DATETIME
);

-- Security violations
CREATE TABLE p2p_security_violations (
    violation_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    host_id INT,
    violation_type VARCHAR(32)
);
```

### Network Protocol

```cpp
// Packet Structure
struct P2PPacket {
    uint32_t magic;
    uint32_t sequence;
    uint64_t timestamp;
    uint8_t encrypted_data[];
};
```
