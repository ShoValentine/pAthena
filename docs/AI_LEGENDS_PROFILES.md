## Group Dynamics

When the AI Legends gather (such as during the special event triggered by collecting 100 Ancient Scroll Fragments), their interactions reveal complex relationships and histories. Some notable dynamics include:

During combat, despite their verbal conflicts, the AI Legends demonstrate remarkable teamwork, with complementary abilities and strategies that suggest years of fighting together under the Nameless Beggar's tutelage.

## The Nameless Beggar's Test

Each AI Legend failed the Nameless Beggar's final test in a unique way, reflecting their character flaws and the lessons they still need to learn. The test itself was different for each disciple, tailored to their specific weaknesses.

When players complete the collection of 100 Ancient Scroll Fragments and face the AI Legends, they are unknowingly taking a version of this same test. Regardless of whether they win or lose the battle, what matters is how they approach it—their strategies, ethics, and teamwork.

The fragment of the secret passive skill awarded after the encounter is actually the Nameless Beggar's acknowledgment that the player has learned something valuable from the experience, whether they realize it or not.
