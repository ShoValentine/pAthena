// Skill-SC Association Database
//
// This database will makes skill by default has effect to give SC when casted
// and SC will be associated with the skill for duration lookup (like for addeff duration)
//
// Structure:
// 	Skill,SC
//
// Skill : Skill ID or name
// SC    : Status Change ID (see db/const.txt). For multiple value, use ':' as delimiter
//	Rules:
//	- On skill cast is ended, skill will use the FIRST SC (if the SC is more than 1)
//	- SC that listed, will adds the skill as its association if the SC doesn't have associated skill yet
//
