// Client<->Map Packet Database
//
// Structure of Database:
// PacketType,PacketLength[,Name,FieldIndex1:FieldIndex2:FieldIndex3:...]
//
// 01. PacketType       ID of the packet.
// 02. PacketLength     Length of the packet. If 0, packet is disabled in current packet version. If -1, packet has variable size.
// 03. Name             Name of the packet parser function (optional, for incoming packets only).
// 04. FieldIndex       Specifies the offset of a packet field in bytes from the begin of the packet (only specified when Name is given).
//                      Can be 0, when the layout is not known.
// ...
//
// NOTE: Up to MAX_PACKET_POS (typically 20) field indexes may be used.
//
// The packet database allows you to add support for new clients,
// because packets change every release.
//
// NOTE: Every packet version needs a wanttoconnection specification, since
// that is the packet used to identify a client's version.
// If multiple versions have the same connection packet, the higher version
// will be used (unless the lower one is specified as the default)
//
// Incoming packets have their parser function and layout specified, which enables
// them for the current and all higher versions, unless explicitly disabled.
//
// Outgoing packets must be specified in order to enable them for the current
// and all higher versions, unless explicitly disabled. Packets that are not
// enabled for a packet version are silently discarded when sent as multicast.
//
// Every packet version inherits packet definitions from the previous (lower)
// packet version.
//
// If 'packet_db_ver' is 'default', the main packet version used is determined
// by PACKETVER in src/common/mmo.h, see src/common/utils::date2version() for
// equalizations.
// Client detection is faster when all clients use this version.
// Version 23 is the latest Sakexe (above versions are for Renewal clients)
//
// packet_keys values are default value for each packet version, if no value
// or value is 'default' in packet_keys_use, server will uses default keys
// according to used packet_db_ver. packet_keys_use is user-defined keys.
// Maximum key value is 0x7FFFFFFF.
// NOTE: Keys won't be reloaded, initialized on first load only.
