# P2P Data Synchronization Configuration
#
# This file configures the secure data synchronization between P2P hosts and the main server.
# It includes settings for Redis caching, pgvector database, and OpenAI/Azure OpenAI embeddings.

# Main server endpoint (required)
# This is the endpoint that P2P hosts will connect to for data synchronization.
# The endpoint should be a secure HTTPS URL that doesn't expose the actual server IP.
# Example: https://sync-proxy.yourdomain.com/p2p-sync

# Redis cache configuration
# Redis is used for caching to improve performance and reduce load on the main server.

# pgvector is used for vector similarity search for AI features.
# Format: postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/dbname
