mercenary_autoloot: yes

// Is getting items from a mercenary disabled when their master's idle?
// Set to no, or the amount of seconds (NOT milliseconds) that need to pass before considering
// a character idle.
// Characters in a chat/vending are always considered idle.
// A character's idle status is reset upon item use/skill use/attack (auto attack counts too)/movement.
