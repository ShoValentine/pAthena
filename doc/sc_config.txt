Type: This is will deciding which status the is Buff or Debuff and the status will be removed on status_change_clear_buffs()
      0 = Buff (default)
      1 = Debuff

---------------------------------------

Notes:

By default, statuses are 'Buff' type (or type 0), which removable by 'status_change_clear_buffs', function that
being used by Tarot (CG_TAROTCARD), Refresh (RK_REFESH), Luxanima (RK_LUXANIMA), Wand of Hermode (CG_HERMODE),
Gospel (PA_GOSPEL), and Inspiration (LG_INSPIRATION).

SCF_NO_CLEARBUFF prevents some permanent statuses and some statuses that cannot be removed by those skills
doesn't matter if the active statuses are buff or debuff or the skill that attempts to remove it.

Tarot and Wand of Hermode are removing status as Buff, not removing Debuff or except status with type 1.
While, Gospel and Inspiration are removing Buffs and Debuffs.

Refresh and Luxanima are only removing status that has flag SCF_REM_ON_REFRESH or SCF_REM_ON_LUXANIMA. Actually
just like Dispell (SA_DISPELL), Clearance (AB_CLEARANCE), and Banishing Buster (RL_BANISHING_BUSTER) that have
effect to remove buffs or debuffs. But, statuses that can be removed by Refresh and Luxanima are less than those
3 skills.
